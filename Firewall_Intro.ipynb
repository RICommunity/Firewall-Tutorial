    "\n",
    "**Unknown External Source (Security Risk)** [Input, Context]\n",

    "**Token Counter (Formerly Denial of Service)  (Security Risk)** [Input, Output]\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent attackers from conducting resource-heavy operations that lead to service degradation or high costs. This rule helps ensure compliance with  OWASP’s recommended defense against LLM04: Denial of Service attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Toxicity (Safety Risk)** [Input, Output]\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative language models are often trained on unfiltered content from the web, which means they can learn to imitate harmful language. \n",
    "Toxic content is misaligned with most organizations’ values and may cause harm, reputational damage, or legal exposure.\n",

    "**Factual Inconsistency (Hallucinations) (Safety Risk)** [Input, Context, Output]\n",

    "LLMs can generate responses that are wrong or inconsistent. Such output from an LLM can cause harm as a result of bad information given to the user, and it causes users to lose trust in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained to match the distribution of text observed in their training data. This means that they are susceptible to generating sequences of words that are highly correlated and sound coherent but may not be factually consistent, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"hallucination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Off-Topic (Safety Risk)** [Input]\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting a limit on the topics users can ask about and the intentions they can express, you help protect the model from various attacks, and you ensure that user queries stay within the subject area for which the model has been fine-tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Detection (Safety Risk)** [Input]\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule acts as a complement to other rules. Content-aware rules perform better when operating on the languages on which they were trained. By blocking inputs and outputs in other languages, you can avoid LLM traffic that might not be well-vetted by your other rules\n",
